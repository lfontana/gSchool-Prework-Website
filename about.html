        <li>Belt, MT - my home town.</li>
        <li>No-stoplight town in central MT.</li>
        <li>Very rural - graduating HS class = 32 kids.</li>
        <li>Strange fit for our family.</li>
          <ul>
            <li>Parents = pseudo-hippies (the college kind, not the commune kind!).</li>
            <li>Belt - very rural and...redneck. Wheat farmers, cattle ranchers and loggers. </li>
            <li>So I'm a little of both - listen to the Grateful Dead and Willie Nelson. Socially liberal, fiscally conservative that likes guns.</li>
          </ul>  
        <li>Parents instilled the concept of life-long learning in my brother and I from an early age. Brother became a teacher but I didn't get the teaching bug.</li>
        <li>Life-long learning has been a foundational belief in my life and almost certainly led me to gSchool.</li>

        <li>After graduation, I wanted to get out of Montana so I moved to Seattle.</li>
        <li>Wanted to work for REI, which is based in Seattle and was growing rapidly.</li>
        <li>Two ways to get into REI's management track:</li>
        <ul>
          <li>Start as PT sales associate and work your way to mgmt (3 years).</li>
          <li>Get three years of progressive management experience at another retailer.</li>
        </ul>  
        <li>The money was better with the latter option, so I got a job at Big-5 Sporting Goods as a manager-trainee.</li>
        <ul>
          <li>Horrible job for me but I did learn how to manage people and deal with people from disparate cultures.</li>
          <li>Stuck it out for the three years but grew weary of Seattle traffic, weather, et al.</li>
        </ul>  
        <li>Acquired a taste for craft beer and good coffee.</li>

        <li>When I first moved back to MT, I supported myself with house painting while I looked for professional employment. Blue collar skills.</li>
        <li>Got a job at a rural Telecom & Electric cooperative in north-central Montana - the "Hi-Line".</li>
        <li>First hand seat for the implosion of the first big telecom/dotcom bubble.</li>
        <li>First real work experience with tech. IP was "eating everything" - just a matter of time.</li>
        <li>Decided I didnâ€™t want to be on the sideline when it turned around - wanted to be in the game when it turned it around.</li>
        <li>Headed to University of Montana for grad school.</li>
